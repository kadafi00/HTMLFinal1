The base foundation and idea is displayed upon the HTMLFinal.html page. It has a background image that is subject to change,
multiple hypertext links that take you to different(as of now blank) pages, and an email hypertext.
There will be javascript funtionality added once I have a better idea of what I want to do
The basic layout is there, I want to add some arrows or something, possibly on the side of the page that take you through
the different pages on the site which will likely be where my JS comes in.
